# shell-status
Shell-status collection of scripts meant to be used (but not limited to) as a simpler alternative to slstatus. 

# man
Unlike some of the other similar scripts, shell-status can be updated without restarting the script. Run status-loop.sh to start the script. Edit bar.sh to edit the layout of statusbar.
